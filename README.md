# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes intermittently fail to apply correctly. The problem is particularly noticeable when combining multiple classes or when using Tailwind alongside other CSS frameworks.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the unpredictable application of Tailwind CSS classes.  Sometimes classes work as expected, other times they don't, with no clear pattern to identify the cause. This leads to inconsistent styling and visual discrepancies across different parts of the application.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server.
4. Observe the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes in the UI.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing class names, ensuring proper configuration, and conflict resolution with other CSS rules.  Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected code implementation.
